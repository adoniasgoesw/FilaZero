# FilaZero Backend - Deployment Guide

## Deployment Issues Fixed

The main deployment issue was related to module resolution and import paths. The following changes were made:

### 1. Simplified Server Structure
- Removed complex database imports that could fail during deployment
- Simplified route handlers to avoid import errors
- Added fallback server options

### 2. File Structure
```
server/
├── server.js          # Main production server
├── server-simple.js   # Fallback simple server
├── index.js           # Development server
├── routes/
│   └── authroutes.js  # Simplified routes
├── controllers/        # Full implementation (not used in simple deployment)
├── config/            # Database configuration
└── middlewares/       # Upload middleware
```

### 3. Deployment Commands
- **Main deployment**: `npm start` (runs `node server.js`)
- **Fallback**: `npm run start:simple` (runs `node server-simple.js`)
- **Development**: `npm run dev` (runs `node index.js`)

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Production: `.env.prod`
- Development: `.env.dev`
- Make sure to set proper environment variables in your deployment platform

### 5. Troubleshooting
If the main server fails:
1. Try the simple server: `npm run start:simple`
2. Check file paths and directory structure
3. Verify all required files are present
4. Check environment variable configuration

### 6. Next Steps
Once the basic deployment is working:
1. Gradually add back the database functionality
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Add back the full route handlers
4. Test each component individually

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic server deployment
- ✅ Simple route structure
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Environment variable loading
- ⏳ Database integration (pending)
- ⏳ Full authentication (pending)
- ⏳ Complete API endpoints (pending)
